        <h1>Avios Redemption Value Calculator</h1>

        <p>When you want to spend your hard-earned Avios on a redemption flight, you're given a range of options depending on how the ratio of cash and Avios you want to spend. This is convenient, but the prices are calculated in such a way that depending how valuable you consider an Avios, some options will be a much better deal than others.</p>

        <p>This tool will easily help you find the best option for you without having to resort to awful, tedious mental math.</p>

        <h2>How much is an Avios worth to you?</h2>

        <p>At the time of writing, at the low end, BA will directly sell you 2,000 Avios for Â£49p, which is 2.45p/Avios, or 1.76p/Avios if you fork over an astonishing Â£3,539 for 200,000 Avios. However, that does not mean that an Avios point is necessarily <em>worth</em> between 1.76 and 2.45p each, it depends on many factors, such as what the cash prices are for the equivalent flight, how much you'd actually be willing to pay for that, whether you have a 2-4-1 voucher, and much more.</p>

        <p>I'd try to explain in further detail myself, but these two articles from my favourite frequent flyer website HeadForPointsâ€”<a href="https://www.headforpoints.com/2023/12/18/my-1p-rule-for-picking-the-best-avios-and-cash-combination-to-book/">My 1p rule for picking the best â€˜Avios and cashâ€™ combination to book</a> and <a href="https://www.headforpoints.com/2022/01/04/what-is-an-avios-point-worth-6/">What is an Avios Point worth?</a> will do a better job than I could.</p>

        <p>If you're not entirely sure or don't have much of an opinion, this tool defaults to an Avios being worth 1p.</p>
